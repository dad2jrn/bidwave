A modern, single-page auction web application built with **React 18**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. BidWave allows users to browse live auctions, list items for sale, place bids, and track auction countdowns — all with no backend required. Data is persisted locally using the browser's `localStorage` API.

> **Note:** This project is a learning exercise for the author designed to explore React and TypeScript fundamentals. It intentionally uses `localStorage` as a flat-file data store in place of a traditional database or API.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | [React 18](https://react.dev/) |
| Language | [TypeScript 5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) |
| Build Tool | [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) |
| Routing | [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/) |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) |
| Persistence | Browser `localStorage` (JSON flat-file) |

## Features

- **Browse Auctions** — View all active listings in a responsive grid
- **Search & Filter** — Filter by keyword or category in real time
- **Create Listings** — Post items with title, description, category, image, and starting bid
- **Bid on Items** — Place bids with live validation against the current high bid
- **Countdown Timers** — Each listing displays time remaining until auction close
- **Persistent Data** — All listings and bids survive page refreshes via `localStorage`

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** `v18.0.0` or higher — [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** `v9.0.0` or higher (bundled with Node.js)
- **Git** — [Download](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installing with Homebrew (macOS recommended)

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the easiest way to manage developer tools on macOS. If you don't have it installed, run this in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install all prerequisites with two commands:

```bash
brew install node   # installs Node.js and npm together
brew install git
```

To upgrade any of these tools in the future:

```bash
brew upgrade node
brew upgrade git
```

### Verifying your installation

Regardless of how you installed them, confirm everything is ready:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dad2jrn/bidwave.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the project directory

```bash
cd bidwave
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**. The development server supports hot module replacement (HMR) — changes you make to source files are reflected in the browser instantly without a full reload.

---

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the local development server |
| `npm run build` | Compile and bundle the app for production |
| `npm run preview` | Locally preview the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across the source files |

## Data Model

All data is stored as JSON in `localStorage` under the key `bidwave_listings`. On first load, the app seeds itself with a small set of sample auction listings.

```typescript
interface Listing {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: Category;
  imageUrl: string;
  startingBid: number;
  currentBid: number;
  sellerName: string;
  endsAt: string;     // ISO 8601 date string
  createdAt: string;  // ISO 8601 date string
  bids: Bid[];
}

interface Bid {
  id: string;
  listingId: string;
  bidderName: string;
  amount: number;
  placedAt: string;   // ISO 8601 date string
}
```

---

## Resetting Local Data

Since all data lives in `localStorage`, you can reset the app to its seed state at any time:

1. Open **DevTools** in your browser (`F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac)
2. Navigate to **Application** → **Local Storage** → `http://localhost:5173`
3. Right-click `bidwave_listings` and select **Delete**
4. Refresh the page — seed data will be restored automatically

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] User authentication (login / registration)
- [ ] Image upload support
- [ ] Email notifications on outbid
- [ ] FastAPI backend to replace `localStorage`
- [ ] PostgreSQL persistence layer
